- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jaykomarraju
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in creating tech products that have a significant impact on consumer behavior
    - Economies that are sprung from within tech ecosystems seems to have a net impact in bringing the world to an energy neutral state. When I talk about impacting consumer behavior it is primarily to make tech economies more accessible across the world.
- ðŸŒ± Gearing towards: Blockchain, AI, Metaverse
